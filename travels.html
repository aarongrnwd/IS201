                        <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p> -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading"> Mexico, the city of  Torreón, Coahuila</h2>
                        <p> Torreón, Coahuila is a city that lies in the northern region of Mexico. It is more of a hot and dry climate where having protection from the sun is a must. You can find many activities to do as well as eat some delicious, albeit very unique, food.</p>

                        <p>One of the many sites you can see is El Cristo de las Noas. A large statue of Christ with his arms spread wide in a welcoming manner that overlooks the city.</p>

                        <p>Mexico has a great selection of delicious food to try. However, sometimes they will have strange ones to try aswell. While in Torreón, I had the opportunity to eat grasshoppers. Have a look at the picture below.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">On the streets of London, England at the Big Ben clock tower.</span>
                        <p>My next stop... London, England. My parents moved to London in 2022 and I had the opportunity to visit them. London is such a large and diverse place with people from all over the world. This creates an amazing atmosphere with so much to do.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/ChinaTownLondon.jpg" alt="China Town, London England" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Exploring what China Town had to offer in London, England.</span>

                        <p>One of the many stops included China Town where we explored the shops and ate great Chinese food. My mom even got to practice her Mandarin skills. Later on, we headed to the streets of London and made a stop at the famous London Tower Bridge.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Paris, France</h2>
                        <p>During my time with my parents, we made a week trip to Paris using the train that goes through the Chunnel (a tunnel that goes underneath the English Channel). This trip included many stops at the iconic places including the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sainte Chapelle, Sainte Chapelle, and Versailles just to name a few.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Eiffel.jpg" alt="Eiffel Tower, Paris France" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">We made a visit to the famous Eiffel Tower during our stay.</span>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/ArcDeTriomphe.jpg" alt="Arc De Triomphe, Paris France" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">A stop at the famous Arc De Triomphe was of course included in our trip.</span>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/SainteChapelle.jpg" alt="Sainte Chapelle, Paris France" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">The interiour of the Sainte Chapelle church in Paris, France is gorgeous.</span>
                        <p>France is well known for their culinary arts. We wouldn't be able to call it a trip to Paris without trying their well known escargot (snail as food). Don't think that eating something slimy you find in your yard is appealing? I wouldn't have thought so either. Surprisingly it is not that bad when they are warm and seasoned. Have a look below.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Escargo.jpg" alt="Eating escargot in Paris France" /></a>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">The Notre Dame church in Paris, France.</span>
                        <p>Our stop at the Notre Dame church only including a marveling at its exterior. Renovations were still underway from the fire that occured in 2019.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="/images/Versailles.jpg" alt="Versailles, Paris France" /></a>
